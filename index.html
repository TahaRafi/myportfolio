                      <p17>The problem our project was trying to solved is that if you created multiple VM of Linux OS. Then you have to maintain all of this means if x VM needs a storage and the other need a networking access etc.Then you have to figure out all of this VM requirement individually. But with the help of OpenStack this task become simple. In OpenStack, resources is divided into 3 form network(neutron), compute(nova) ,and storage(cinder). With the help of this division if you have 1000 of virtual machine you easily handle it by using OpenStack.</p17>

        			<h2>FINAL YEAR PROJECT</h2>

        		<h4>UNBIASED NEWS BASED ON GEO LOCATION</h4>

          <h5>Abstract</h5>
          <p>This project is basically motivated by the aspect that nowadays we have very limited
unbiased news sources, so we are trying to give the news events based on user&#39;s stories.
Now each user in our app has the authority to take and post pictures of events which are
harmful or can cause harm to other users, once these pictures are posted they will be geo
tagged and time stamped by our app which can be viewed by other user and they can save
themselves by knowing about these events before even going to the place where the
event is taking place. Our motivation for this project is to save people from these events
thus saving there a lot of time and money. The events can include traffic jam, Road
blocked, Roads on fire, accidents on roads, fallen trucks, kidnapping, rally, protests, crimes
etc. If people get to know about these events in real time so they can take the other road
or the same road and different direction, this will not only save their time and money but
will also keep them safe while they are travelling.</p>

								<p>I have seen a lot of people in my 4 years at fast, not many as hard working as Taha. He is the kind of person that has the ability to make entire projects by himself. He's amazing in group settings as well. I have known him for 4 years, and I've known him to be an amazing friend, a great guy to talk to, and a great teacher as well.
Sadly, I don't think I've worked with him on any projects, but I would definitely have liked to, and Inshaallah I would be happy to work with him in the future</p>
